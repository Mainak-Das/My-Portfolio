## Portfolio Highlights

### Project 1: DigiXam

Description: DigiXam is a web-based online examination system. I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for designing the frontend, and the backend is designed using Java and MySQL (the database). This Online Examination System is a software solution, that allows any institute or organization to arrange, conduct, and manage examinations via an online environment.
The main goal of this online examination system is to effectively evaluate the student through a totally automated system that saves a lot of time for the users. It gives a single platform environment to evaluate all the things together.
